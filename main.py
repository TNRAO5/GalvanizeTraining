# Personal Finance Tracker
# Description: Build an application that helps users track their personal finances, including income, expenses, and budgeting. The application should allow users to input their financial transactions and categorize them (e.g., groceries, utilities, salary). It could also provide simple statistics on spending.

# Minimum Requirements:

# Create functions for different financial calculations and operations (e.g., adding transactions, categorizing expenses, calculating totals).
# Use Pythonâ€™s standard libraries for working with dates and currency.
# Store financial data in a suitable container, allowing for filtering and sorting by date, category, etc.
# Implement TDD using pytest for your financial calculations and operations.
# Explore third-party libraries for data visualization (e.g., Matplotlib or Plotly) to show spending trends over time.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Key Features:

# Add Expenses: Users can input their expenses by providing the date (in YYYY-MM-DD format), expense category, and the amount spent. The application stores this information in a text file named "expenses.txt" for future reference.

# View Expenses: The Expense Tracker displays all recorded expenses in a tabular format. It presents details such as the date, expense category, and amount, along with a total expense calculated from the accumulated amounts.

# Delete Expenses: Users can delete any unwanted expense from the list by selecting the corresponding entry and clicking the "Delete Expense" button. The entry will be removed from both the GUI and the "expenses.txt" file.
